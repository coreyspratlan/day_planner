# day_planner\

This is an app that allows the user to add in events to a day planner.

The goal is to add an event to the calendar, save the event, and have the information stored locally.  

Each of the hour blocks are color coded dynamically with the current time.
For example, when the present time is shown on the calendar, the background changeds to red while the past time blocks have a background of gray, and the future time blocks have a backgrond of green.

The current time is displayed in the jumbotron and changed dynamically with each day.
